# Hadeel Abdelhamid JAVA Alternative Language Project

## For this assignment, I went ahead and chode Java as my language of choice. 
The version of Java used is 11. I chose Java because this object-oriented language allows for usability and accesibility, it's extremely portable. 
I feel like by using this assignment to take the opportunity to expand my knowledge on the Java language, I can further apply this to my career in the future.
Another thing about java that caught my interest is that it can be used on any platform without any hinderance.  

## How does Java handle programming constructs
<li>Object oriented Programming: Java is fully object oriented. It all runs under series of classes and objects. But this aspect also makes it so that programmers can re-use the code. 
<li>File Ingestion: There are various packages in Java that allow reading and writing of files. 
<li>Conditional Statements: Java uses ternary operatos '?:' , switch, else is, and if else statements. 
<li>Assignment Statments: Just as I learned in C and C++, Java is no different. Java uses = to assign values and the data types int, double, float, etc. 
<li>Loops: Loops are utilized in java to execute code until stated conidition is met. Loops are initialized by for, while, or do-while. 
<li>Subprograms: Methods in java are defined within specific classes. They can be modified to public, protected, default, or private and can be static or instance based. 
<li>Unit Testing and Exception Handling: Testing sections of code in Java is most commonly done using Junit. Exception handling precents crashes and unexpected behaviors from occuring.

## Java Libraries I Used
Three java libraries I used in this assignment are java.io.File, java.util.Set and java.util.Scanner. Java.ioFile is used to read abd write data from files and to. For this assignment, it was used mainly to read the phone dats from the cells.csv
that was provided as part of this assignment. This library allows for interaction with Files and completion of different types of tasks like creating new files, ensuring the file is available and valid and reading the data from files. 
Java.util.set was used to extract unique launches that were in the cells.CSV file. It is overall used to organize different status in any data set provided. Finally, I also used java.util.Scanner which is essentially a scanner that parses through data. In this case, it was used to
go through the cells.csv file and identify the different data types to then be parsed.
